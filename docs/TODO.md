# TO-DO list

- Make code more general to allow for stuff like T150/T248/T500 to be relatively easily included.

- Use workqueues instead of doing everything in t300rs_timer

- Document changes to code in an organised manner.

### T248
- open/close seems to crash the wheel and the kernel along with it, check how Windows handles it
- fix rdesc, 0x0a somewhere needs to be set to 0x60
